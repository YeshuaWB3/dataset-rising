# OS Setup Scripts

These scripts are used to set up a new vanilla OS installation so that it can be used with
the rest of the scripts in this repository.

Typically, you will only need to do this if you are setting up a new machine for training,
for example a new EC2, Google Cloud, Vast AI, RunPod, etc. instance. 

You do not need to run these scripts on your local machine.
